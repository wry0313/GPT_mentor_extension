# GPT_mentor_extension

GPT Mentor is a chrome extension that tracks your website usage by retrieving info of the current tabs your staying on and allows you to generate a report using chatgpt that summarizes your focus and what you can do to be more productive.

I documented my journey of making this extension on my personal blog site: https://www.gavinwang.dev/posts/chrom_extension_zero_to_one. 
The chrome extension page is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpt-mentor/bmlbikjekoeckeopfnokkafbohkdfggm?hl=en&authuser=0.
